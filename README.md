<h1 align="center">Hello 👋, I am Joey Parker:exclamation:</h1>

<h3 align="left">About Me: :fire:</h3>

I am a Senior CS undergraduate at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**.

I love to learn new technologies and to create.

- 🔭 I'm currently finishing up my personal Unreal Engine project - **Automafarm!** My goal with this project is to learn the Unreal engine and to create my first 3D game. You can see my progress at [Automafarm Repository](https://github.com/Ninjajkl/Automafarm) or download the latest build at [Automafarm Itch Page](https://ninjajkl.itch.io/automafarm).
- 🔬 I'm also finishing up a group Godot game for the Game Developers at UNCC Club’s 49er Kickoff Game Jam, **Rogue Science**. In this project, I am the Lead Programmer, Level Designer, and Project Manager. You can see the progress at [Rogue Science Repository](https://github.com/SweetFrontier/RogueScience) or download the latest build at [Rogue Science Itch Page](https://sweetfrontier.itch.io/rogue-science).
- 🐄 In Spring 2023 I was part of a group for the UNCC Club’s 49hr Game Jam, where we made **OrbitaLoop (Orbital Loop)**. In this project, I was the Lead Programmer, Game Designer, and Project Manager. You can see the finished [OrbitaLoop Repository](https://github.com/Ninjajkl/Orbit-Loop/tree/MouseControl) and download the full game at [OrbitaLoop Itch Page](https://sakarmit.itch.io/orbital-loop)
- 🎅 Every year I challenge myself to complete the year's Advent of Code. Last year, I challenged myself by doing it in Python! You can see all of my solutions at [AdventOfCode2022](https://github.com/Ninjajkl/AdventOfCode2022)
- 🌱 At UNCC, I am learning Artificial Intelligence in Games, Event-Driven Programming, and next Semester (Spring 2024), Game Engine Construction.
